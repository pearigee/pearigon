    - Design
      - My hope is to add points at your current mouse position via
        the hotkeys ~s~ for sharp and ~r~ for round.
      - The round points will become quadratic SVG points.
      - I will need the ability to draw a tool overlay.
    - [ ] Initial prototype.

* Bugs
** Navigation [0/1]
   - [ ] Need to scale scrolling with zoom level.
